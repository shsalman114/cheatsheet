# Adding Interactivity

In React, data that changes over time is called state. You can add state to any component, and update it as needed.

## Responding to Events

- Event handlers are your own functions that will be triggered in response to interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on.

#### Adding event handlers 

1. First of all, Define a function 
1. Implement the logic inside that function (use alert to show the message).
1. And then pass it as a *prop* to the appropriate JSX tag.

**Example:-**

1. Declare a function called `handleClick` inside your `Button` component.
2. Implement the logic inside that function (use `alert` to show the message).
3. Add `onClick={handleClick}` to the `<button>` JSX.

```jsx
export default function Button() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('You clicked me!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```


 <table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>passing a function (correct)</td>
      <td>calling a function (incorrect)</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>

  ```jsx
  <button onClick={handleClick}>
  ```
      
  </td>
  <td>

  ```jsx
  <button onClick={handleClick()}>    
  ```
  
  </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>

  ```jsx
  <button onClick={() => alert('...')}>	
  ```
      
  </td>
  <td>

  ```jsx
  <button onClick={alert('...')}>
  ```
  
  </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>



#### Reading props in event handlers 

Because event handlers are declared inside of a component, they have access to the component’s props. Here is a button that, when clicked, shows an alert with its `message` prop:

```jsx
function AlertButton({ message, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => alert(message)}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <AlertButton message="Playing!">
        Play Movie
      </AlertButton>
      <AlertButton message="Uploading!">
        Upload Image
      </AlertButton>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Passing event handlers as props 

- Depending on where you’re using a Button component, you might want to *execute* a **different function**—perhaps one plays a movie and another uploads an image.

- To do this, pass a prop the component receives from its parent as the event handler like so:

- for more info follow this [link](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events#passing-event-handlers-as-props)

```jsx
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

function PlayButton({ movieName }) {
  function handlePlayClick() {
    alert(`Playing ${movieName}!`);
  }

  return (
    <Button onClick={handlePlayClick}>
      Play "{movieName}"
    </Button>
  );
}

function UploadButton() {
  return (
    <Button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>
      Upload Image
    </Button>
  );
}

export default function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <PlayButton movieName="Kiki's Delivery Service" />
      <UploadButton />
    </div>
  );
}

```

#### Naming event handler props 

- when you’re building your own components, you can name their event handler props any way that you like.
By convention, event handler props should start with `on`, followed by a capital letter.

For example, the `Button` component’s `onClick` prop could have been called `onSmash`

```jsx
function Button({ onSmash, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onSmash}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onSmash={() => alert('Playing!')}>
        Play Movie
      </Button>
      <Button onSmash={() => alert('Uploading!')}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> All events propagate in React except `onScroll`, which only works on the JSX tag you attach it to.

#### Stopping propagation 

1. That event object also lets you stop the propagation. If you want to prevent an event from reaching parent components, you need to call `e.stopPropagation()` like this `Button` component does:
1. Follow this [Link](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events#stopping-propagation) to know more.

```jsx
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={e => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      onClick();
    }}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div className="Toolbar" onClick={() => {
      alert('You clicked on the toolbar!');
    }}>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Playing!')}>
        Play Movie
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

#### Passing handlers as alternative to propagation 

- follow this [Link](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events#passing-handlers-as-alternative-to-propagation)

#### Preventing default behavior 

- Some browser events have default behavior associated with them. For example, a `<form>` submit event, which happens when a button inside of it is clicked, will *reload the whole page* by default:
- You can call `e.preventDefault()` on the event object to stop this from happening:

```jsx
<form onSubmit={e => {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert('Submitting!');
    }}>
      <input />
      <button>Send</button>
    </form>
```

Don’t confuse `e.stopPropagation()` and `e.preventDefault()`. They are both useful, but are unrelated:

- `e.stopPropagation()`: stops the event handlers attached to the tags above from firing.
- `e.preventDefault()`: prevents the default browser behavior for the few events that have it.


## State: A Component's Memory

Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, current image, etc. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called *state*.


1. Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is rendering
1. **Hook** start with `use...` like `useState`, `useAffect`, etc... It can only be called at the top level of your components or your own Hooks.
1. State is just one of those features, but you will meet the other Hooks later.

The `useState` Hook provides those two things:

1. The array returned by `useState` always has exactly two items.
1. A **state variable** to retain the data between renders.
1. A **state setter function** to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.

#### Adding a state variable 

1. Import useState from React at the top of the file:
    - ```jsx
      import { useState } from 'react';
      ```
1. Add this code in the file.
    - ```jsx
      const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
      ```
> NOTE The convention is to name this pair like `const [index, setindex]`. You ***could name it anything*** you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.


#### Giving a component multiple state variables

1. It is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like index and showMore in this example.
1. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be easier to combine them into one.
1. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it’s more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. Read [Choosing the State Structure](https://react.dev/learn/choosing-the-state-structure) for more tips.


#### State is isolated and private 

1. If you render the same component twice, *each copy* will have completely ***isolated state***! Changing one of them will not affect the other.

## Render and Commit

This process of requesting and serving UI has three steps:

1. Triggering a render (delivering the guest’s order to the kitchen)
1. Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
1. Committing to the DOM (placing the order on the table)

#### Step 1: Trigger a render 


1. Initial render 
    - it’s done by calling createRoot with the target DOM node, and then calling its render method with your component 
      ```jsx
      import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
      root.render(<Image />);
      ```

2. The component’s (or one of its ancestors’) state has been updated.

#### Step 2: React renders your components 

After you trigger a render, React calls your components to figure out what to display on screen. “Rendering” is React calling your components.


#### Step 3: React commits changes to the DOM 

Follow this [link](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit#step-3-react-commits-changes-to-the-dom)
